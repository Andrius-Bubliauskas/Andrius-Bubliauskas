ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andrius-Bubliauskas. I studied Medicinal Chemistry for my Master's and Digitizing Chemistry for my PhD. Much of my work revolved around translating chemistry processes to 3D-printed reactors and all sorts of automated synthesis platforms. I have spent a considerable amount of time honing my skills as a synthetic chemist throughout. Recently, I've pivoted towards prep-HPLC and UPLC-MS instrument care, operation and operationalization at scale. More and more I dabble in coding and all things data science related. I want to learn as much as I can about math, computers and data science to push the development of the interface between chemistry, automation and data science [@Chemify](https://chemify.io/). Outside of work I enjoy climbing, yoga, motorbikes, and mindful philosophies.
