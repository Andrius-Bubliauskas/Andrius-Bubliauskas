ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andrius-Bubliauskas. I studied Medicinal Chemistry for my Master's and Digitizing Chemistry for my PhD. I've translated chemistry processes to 3D-printed reactors and automated platforms. Recently, I honed my skills as a bench chemist and moved towards prep-HPLC and UPLC-MS instrument care, operation and operationalization at scale. More and more I dabble in coding and all things data science related.

Outside of work I enjoy climbing, yoga, motorbikes and mindful philosophies.
